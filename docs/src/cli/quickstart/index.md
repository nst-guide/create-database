# Quickstart

This folder has overviews of the available CLI commands.

Essentially, if it's a standard process to create and upload certain data to S3
for the website or mobile app, I'll try to document the sequence of commands in
a file here.

For full options, check the API for each command, which is also available by
appending `--help` to the command.
